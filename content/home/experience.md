  * **Baggage Re-Identification for Smart Security Inspection**: Extensively investigated past architectures for
  person and vehicle re-identification (re-ID) tasks. Implemented multiple architectures and evaluated their
  performance for baggage re-ID. Achieved a 0.76 accuracy of CMC rank-1 (improving the baseline by a 0.34 margin
  in accuracy and about 100x in speed) on the overall re-ID task (image retrieval from the 500-baggage gallery) on
  the Multi-View Baggage dataset.

  * **Testing Framework Development**: Developed a fork upon the open-source deep-person-reid framework for the
  teamâ€™s future research and deployment workflow, including features such as activation visualization, training
  checkpoint management, Comet.ml integration, and CLI tools.
