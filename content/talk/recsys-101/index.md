This talk introduces the fundamentals of recommender systems to those unfamiliar. The talk covers the motivations for recommender systems, a typical pipline inside a recommender system, and several basic models for CTR prediction (LR, Poly2, and (F)FM). A dicussion on the ethical implication of recsys is included at the end.
