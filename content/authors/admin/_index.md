I am a junior at Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science. I major in Artificial Intelligence and minor in Computational Finance.

My current interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and scalable, distributed systems. I interned at the recommender systems team at ByteDance summer 2020 and devised ML algorithms and systems for billion-DAU products.

I'm actively seeking internship opportunities for Summer 2021 during which I wish I could explore new knowledge and different career opportunities. Specifically, I'm looking for software/algorithm engineering or quantitative analysis roles. Please shoot me an email or direct message if you have such opportunities!
